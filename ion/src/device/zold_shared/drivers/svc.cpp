/* According to arm documentation, available at :
 * https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0042/latest/
 *  Typically, the registers r4-r8, r10 and r11 (v1-v5, v7 and v8) are used to
 *  hold the values of a routineâ€™s local variables. Of these, only v1-v4 can be
 *  used uniformly by the whole Thumb instruction set, but the AAPCS does not
 *  require that Thumb code only use those registers.
 *  A subroutine must preserve the contents of the registers r4-r8, r10, r11
 *  and SP (and r9 in PCS variants that designate r9 as v6).
 * r10 and r8 are less likely to be used by other routines.
 * To preserve the contents of the registers, their content is stored on the
 * Stack and put back after using svc().
 * TODO Hugo : Consider a "typical" ARM subroutine calling convention :
 * - In the prologue, push r4 to r11 to the stack, and push the return address
 *   in r14 to the stack (this can be done with a single STM instruction);
 * - Copy any passed arguments (in r0 to r3) to the local scratch registers (r4
 *   to r11);
 * - Allocate other local variables to the remaining local scratch registers (r4
 *   to r11);
 * - Do calculations and call other subroutines as necessary using BL, assuming
 *   r0 to r3, r12 and r14 will not be preserved;
 * - Put the result in r0;
 * - In the epilogue, pull r4 to r11 from the stack, and pull the return address
 *   to the program counter r15. This can be done with a single LDM instruction.
 * If we had a better control on how the code is assembled around svc calls, we
 * could almost retrieve the parameters from r0-r3, and wouldn't have to deal
 * with previous registers, as they should be automatically saved on the stack.
